I have just realised that `essay.txt` contains a lot of duplicated text.

Some paragraphs appear several times.

This was purely a copy‑and‑paste mistake.

The actual intended content is only about one‑fifth of the current `essay.txt`.

This error does not affect any of the issues discussed in the article.
